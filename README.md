# Spellcheck
Simple implementation of Levenshtein distance (brute force and dynamic programming) as a method for misspelled word suggestion. Uses a text file with 1000 words as the "dictionary" of existing words. User can enter words, and if the word is not in the dictionary, the 5 closest matches based on Levenshtein distance are provided.
